A lightweight, neurodivergent-friendly pet care tracker designed to manage feeding schedules, calorie tracking, medication, and weight trends without overwhelm.

Built with structure and organised love in mind 🌸.

## Project Status
Early development – features are being incrementally added.
I am just one person and I'm taking care of my cat Arya who has had surgery recently and so it is being developed in my spare time when not taking care of her.
Patience is appreciated.

## Why I Built This
I built this while caring for my 16-year-old cat, Arya, after a recent surgery.  
She needed carefully monitored feeding, calorie tracking, and timed medications. I quickly realised how stressful it can be to manage all of that without a clear system.  

This tracker started as a way to organise Arya’s recovery and make sure she received the care she needed. I’m sharing it in the hope that it might help anyone else caring for an older pet, managing post-surgery recovery, or simply wanting a gentler way to stay organised.  

Because sometimes love looks like spreadsheets, reminders, and making sure the tiny creature in your care gets exactly what they need 💛.
