## Why I Built This

I built this project while caring for my 16-year-old cat, Arya, after a recent surgery.  
She needed carefully monitored feeding, calorie tracking, and timed medications and I quickly realised how stressful it can be to manage all of that without a clear system.

Between tracking how much she was eating, spacing medications correctly, and monitoring her weight, I wanted something simple, calm, and structured. Not overwhelming. Not cluttered. Just clear and reliable.

This tracker started as a way to organise Arya’s recovery and make sure she received the care she needed. I’m sharing it in the hope that it might help anyone else caring for an older pet, managing post-surgery recovery, or simply wanting a gentler way to stay organised.

Because sometimes love looks like spreadsheets, reminders, and making sure the tiny creature in your care gets exactly what they need. 💛
